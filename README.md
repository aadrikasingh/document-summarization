# Document Summarization Using Azure OpenAI
Document summarization is a vital tool in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and information retrieval, aimed at extracting the most important information from a document or a set of documents. In this guide, we will walk through the concept of document summarization, why chunking might be necessary, and how to utilize Azure OpenAI's GPT models for this task. We'll cover two main approaches: map-reduce and refine.

## Chunking
A long document consists of multiple ideas, points, arguments, or facts. Directly summarizing a long document as a whole can result in loss of crucial context or details. To avoid this, we chunk a document into smaller parts, allowing us to maintain the document's informational hierarchy and make the summarization process more manageable and efficient.

Chunking can also help to deal with the maximum token limit constraint in models like Davinci-003, ChatGPT or GPT-4, where the total number of input tokens (including the document and any instructions) can't exceed the model's specified limit.

## Summarization Approaches
### 1. Map-Reduce
The Map-Reduce approach is a computational model that can efficiently process and generate summaries of large data sets. In the context of document summarization:

**Map:** This step involves chunking the document into smaller pieces and summarizing each piece individually.

**Reduce:** Here, all the individual summaries are combined to form the final summary.

This approach allows distributed processing of large documents, but one of the challenges here is to ensure the final summary maintains a coherent flow of information.

### 2. Refine
The refine approach is a two-step process:

**Initial Summary:** Create an initial summary of the document using any chosen summarization technique.

**Refinement:** Use additional computational models to further refine and condense the initial summary.

This method is useful when there's a need to create a highly condensed summary while retaining the most crucial information.

## Benefits of Using GPT Models for Summarization
- **Quality**: GPT model's understanding of natural language is sophisticated, resulting in high-quality summaries that retain key points and context.

- **Flexibility**: You can instruct GPT models to generate summaries of varying lengths according to your needs.

- **Language Support**: GPT models can generate summaries in multiple languages, making it versatile for global use cases.

- **Scalability**: With proper chunking and techniques like map-reduce or refine, GPT models can handle large documents effectively.

## Deployment Guide

This deployment guide guides you through the process of creating and deploying an Azure Function, which can be using for summarization.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed or set up:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): An open-source code editor developed by Microsoft.
2. [Azure Functions Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions): This extension aids in creating, testing, and deploying Azure Functions from VS Code.
3. [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-functions-core-tools): It provides a local development experience for creating, developing, testing, running, and debugging Azure Functions.
4. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): A JavaScript runtime needed to run the Azure Functions Core Tools.
5. [Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com/): You'll need an Azure subscription to deploy your function app to Azure. If you don't have one, you can create a free account.

## Steps to Create and Deploy an Azure Function

### Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository on your local machine

### Step 2: Create a function app

### Step 3: Deploy the Function to Azure through VS Code

1. Click on the Azure icon in the Activity Bar again.
2. In the Azure: Functions area, click on the Deploy to Function App icon.
3. Follow the prompts to choose your subscription, select 'Create new Function App in Azure', and provide a unique name for the function app.
4. Choose a location for new resources and a runtime for the function app.
5. VS Code will start the deployment process. Once the deployment is complete, a notification will appear.
6. Click on the 'Go to resource' button in the notification to view your deployed function in the Azure portal.
